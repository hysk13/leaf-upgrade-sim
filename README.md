# Leaf Upgrade Simulator

Hello, this is @hys_13 writing this (on behalf of me and @snu_08 because snu doesn't have a GitHub account, only Discord).

This is our project- Leaf Upgrade Simulator.
Leaf Upgrade Simulator is a simple Discord bot which hosts a simple game.
The objective of the game is very simple- You upgrade your leaf, sell it, and up your rank.

This project was made on replit and uses replit's built-in (?) database (it's replit db) to store user data, so if it is ran out of replit, it may not work. (I tried once in VSCode, and some features failed to function)

We are not good at this, so yes, the source code is VERY messy and inefficient. If you're planning on reading it, please keep that in mind.

This project uses Replit DB and Discord.py to run.
We will constantly try to improve the code, and push whenever possible.

Our Priorities on Adding:
-GitHub pages page containing all the commands (Maybe)
-Changing all text responses to embeds (if time)

P.S. We cannot keep this bot hosted 24/7 but we will host it whenever we are playing them :D (hehe)

Thank you for reading this long README.md~ :D
